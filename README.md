# Background üìà
A subdomain takeover unlike it sounds is basically the acquisition of the service that the subdomain is pointing to. For example taking over an Amazon S3 Bucket that `marketing.target.com` was point to a while ago. Since, the subdomain was pointing to the service which is now owned by me aka the attacker in this scenario, we can say that i've taken over the subdomain now. 

```bash
marketing.vulnerable.com -> AMAZON S3 Bucket
hr.vulnerable.com -> Elastic Beanstalk
```

# About Subrake üí∞
Subrake, initially designed for subdomain gathering using public sources and brute forcing through wordlists is a toolkit for subdomain gathering and takeover assessment.

Designed primarily for bug bounty and infosec industry, it can be leveraged for blue teaming and internal pentests as well. It supports both a CLI and Web Based GUI Interface as well and supports multiple installation modes. We will cover the key features a little later after the Installation step. 

# Features ‚öñÔ∏è
* ‚öôÔ∏è All in one automated solution. Its working cycle is:
    * DNS Enumeration
    * False Positive Detection (Wildcard subdomains)
    * Getting results from other tools (Sublist3r, Knock.py)
    * Bruteforce using wordlists (Can work with multiple wordlists)
    * Get 5 parameters for each subdomain (HTTP Codes, Resolution, Headers, CNAME, Ports)
    * **Detect Takeover**
* üõí Support for external tools. You can add your own functions.
* üõçÔ∏è Automated and Manual Mode.
* üóÑÔ∏è Can run concurrent sessions.
* üñºÔ∏è UI for Reports and results available in `csv` format.
* üõéÔ∏è Flexible and Fast. 

# Installation
You can install su
# Automated Setup:
You can install subrake as per your preferences. You can have the plain simple command line version or a web based terminal having a reports page to manage your scans and be on the go. What we will cover here is: 

* CLI
    * Simple Python Setup
    * Docker
* GUI (Web Based)
    * Vagrant
    * Baremetal (Ubuntu Server)

Clone the repo and jump into it: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hash3liZer/Subrake.git
$ cd ./Subrake
```

## CLI
### Simple Python Setup
Install the requirements and run `setup.py`:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 setup.py install
```

Verify if subrake is installed or not: 
```bash
subrake --version
```

### Docker
Build the docker image from `Dockerfile`:
```bash
$ docker build -t subrake:latest .
```

Verify the docker container:
```bash
$ docker run --rm subrake --version
```

## GUI (Web Based)
The web provides more of a control and management over your scans. You can easily manage your scans, download reports, delete runs and have as many concurrent sessions as you want. The web is based on a terminal and a reports page. The terminal acts as an actual terminal and runs inside a `tmux` session. 

### Vagrant
With vagrant, you can provision a box quickly and have everything automatically setup for you. Subrake uses `libvirt` provider here. So, install all the necessary dependencies first: 
```python
$ apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager vagrant vagrant-libvirt
```

Then inside the repository run this command: 
```python
$ vagrant up
```

This uses the default credentials `subrake/password` for the Cockpit interface. To modify it, you can use: 
```python
$ SUBRAKE_USERNAME="username" SUBRAKE_PASSWORD="password" vagrant up
```

It would take a while for the provisioning to complete. After done, you can access the web interface at: http://127.0.0.1:9090

### Baremetal
You can also install it on a baremetal server. But this is only tested on `Ubuntu 20.04`. You can modify the installer script as per your need if you are on a different flavor. 

```python
$ chmod +x ./installer.sh
$ ./installer.sh --deploy
```

## Documentation
### Installation
Installing stable version directly from PYPI:
```bash
$ pip3 install subrake
```

Installing latest build:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hash3liZer/Subrake.git
$ cd Subrake/
$ python3 setup.py install
```

Run after installation:
```bash
$ subrake --help
```

### Usage
Subrake is highly flexible and is made to work under different situations. It can parse output files from multiple tools collectively. It does OSINT search alongside wordlist bruteforcing and before actual bruteforcing, it removes similar subdomains and false positives. It does also support a filter which when supplied allows you to seperate subdomains with same IP addresses in the final CSV result. Let's see some of the Subrake uses:

A simple run with OSINT results from search engines:
```bash
$ subrake -d google.com
```

Subrake with Multiple Threads:
```bash
$ subtake -d google.com -t 50
```

Subrake with OSINT results + SecLists subdomains list:
```bash
$ subrake -d google.com --wordlists SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
```

Subrake with OSINT results + Multiple SecLists subdomains list: <br>
**Note: Subdomains with similar names will automatically be filtered and counted as 1**
```bash
$ subrake -d google.com --wordlists SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt,SecLists/Discovery/DNS/dns-Jhaddix.txt
```

Subrake without OSINT + Output from multiple tools combined + IP Filtering:
```bash
$ domain="google.com"
$ subfinder -d $domain -nW -o $domain/1.txt && sublist3r -d $domain -o $domain/2.txt && cat $domain/* >> /tmp/output.txt
$ subrake -d $domain -w tmp/output.txt --filter --skip-search
```

Subrake without DNS + OSINT:
```bash
$ subrake -d google.com --skip-dns
```

Subrake with Port Scanning: <br>
**NOTE: The port 80,443 will be scanned by default for every host under HTTP/HTTPS banner. So, there's no need to specify them here**
```bash
$ subrake -d google.com --ports 8080,8443,8000,23,445
```
